"""Mint a memory carrying a document's body on every document write.

Why this exists
---------------
The two stores are not cross-searched: ``caura_recall`` never returns
documents, and a document row embeds only ``data["summary"]`` — never its body.
So a document's *content* is unreachable by meaning; you can only find it if you
already know its ``collection`` + ``doc_id``. Minting a memory that carries the
document's data closes that gap for the paths that read ``memories.content``
directly (``caura_recall`` and the recall brief, neither of which truncates).

CAURA-717: that memory carries the WHOLE ``data`` payload rendered as text with
``summary`` first — not one guessed field. The previous rule required
``data["content"]`` or ``data["body"]``, which no producer is obliged to use;
eToro's only organic doc feed has neither, so every write returned 200 and
silently minted nothing. See ``doc_indexing._render_doc_data``.

Rewrite semantics come free from ``write_mode="fast"``
-----------------------------------------------------
Every doc write runs this same path — there is no create-vs-update branch and no
lookup of previously minted rows. That is not as duplicative as it sounds,
because the fast write pipeline (``pipeline/compositions/write.py``) already
runs ``CheckExactDuplicate`` then ``DetectNearDuplicate``:

  * identical body      -> ``CheckExactDuplicate`` raises 409, no row is written.
                           Idempotent doc re-syncs self-dedupe.
  * changed body, close -> row is written PLUS ``metadata["near_duplicate_of"]``
                           pointing at the previous version (advisory only at
                           ``SEMANTIC_DEDUP_JUDGE_THRESHOLD``; it does not reject).
  * changed body, far   -> row is written, no link.

Known limitation: nothing outdates or supersedes the older rows, so a doc edited
N times leaves N active memories and recall can surface several versions.
``metadata["near_duplicate_of"]`` is the thread a future reconciliation pass
would follow.

Contract for callers
--------------------
Use ``safe_sync_doc_memory``. It never raises: the document is the source of
truth and must never fail to persist because a derived memory could not be
written.

Latency: this runs INLINE, deliberately
---------------------------------------
``write_mode="fast"`` defers only ENRICHMENT (the LLM call). Everything else in
the write pipeline still runs awaited inside the caller's request:
``ParallelEmbedEnrich`` (embedding), ``CheckExactDuplicate``,
``DetectNearDuplicate``, ``WriteMemoryRow``. Measured on a VM against real
providers, that is ~210 ms per document write:

    write_mode=fast  embedding_ms=151  dedup_lookup_ms=9  storage_ms=16
    total_ms=210     enrichment_pending=True

plus a ``resolve_config`` read and a ``get_or_create_agent`` upsert. So a doc
write that previously only embedded a short summary now costs ~210 ms more.

Accepted for now. The handlers are ``async def`` and every wait is on I/O, so
the event loop keeps serving other requests throughout — the cost is added to
the calling request's response, not to server throughput. For interactive
one-document-at-a-time writes that is not worth optimising.

Deliberately NOT moved to ``track_task``, which is ``asyncio.create_task`` —
same process, no queue and no durability. Backgrounding would hide the 210 ms
but would also mean a doc write can return 200 while its memory never
materialises: nothing retries, and ``cancel_all_tasks()`` kills in-flight tasks
on shutdown, so a write landing during a deploy would silently lose its memory.
Today a 200 guarantees the memory exists, which is the stronger property.

Revisit if bulk doc sync becomes a real workload — at ~210 ms each, 10k
documents is ~35 minutes of added wall-clock. The cheapest win then is dropping
the unconditional ``get_or_create_agent`` round-trip (on the MCP path
``enforce_fleet_write`` has already registered the caller), before reaching for
a durable queue.

    Prefers the real document writer. Attribution is not cosmetic:
    ``caura_insights`` defaults to ``scope="agent"``, which filters
    ``Memory.agent_id == agent_id``, so a row attributed to the service identity
    is invisible to every real agent's default insights run.

    Falls back to ``DOC_INDEXER_AGENT_ID`` only when the caller has no identity
    at all (REST ``POST /documents`` with no gateway-stamped ``X-Agent-ID``).

    Registration is unconditional, and that matters. The MCP write path calls
    ``enforce_fleet_write`` before minting, which registers the caller on first
    contact — but REST ``POST /documents`` has no equivalent step. Returning the
    caller's id without registering it produced a memory attributed to an
    identity with no ``agents`` row, which ``caura_insights`` then refuses to
    run for ("Agent X is not registered"), making the minted memory unreachable
    by the default ``scope="agent"`` pass. Found in the wet test on
    ``eyal-wet-tests``. ``get_or_create_agent`` is an idempotent upsert, so the
