# (#687). Division of labour: FTS_WEIGHT is the *preference* between the two
# signals; this is the *unit conversion* that makes the preference meaningful.
#
# The input to the derivation: migration 001 builds ``search_vector`` as a bare
# ``to_tsvector('english', content)`` with no ``setweight``, so every lexeme is
# weight D = 0.1 and a modal single-occurrence match scores ts_rank_cd = 0.1 →
# 0.0909, against measured cosine of 0.35-0.39. Re-derive if that trigger starts
# weighting lexemes; changing FTS_WEIGHT alone does NOT require it.
#
# Why 6: derived, not tuned. k*0.1/(1+k*0.1) ≈ 0.37 lands a modal match in the
# cosine range. Do not treat it as a free dial.
#
# Calibrated at the MODE, not across the distribution: ts_rank_cd's cover-density
# penalty is not a constant factor, so a spread-out multi-term match still lands
# well below the band. That residual is arguably right — spread terms are a worse
# match — but it means "effective ≈ nominal weight" describes the typical query,

    enough — for a gate within the margin of the cap that clamp lands exactly ON

    raised the gate to a legitimate value below it. So when the full margin doesn't
