"""GCP Pub/Sub event bus — used in SaaS deployments.

Publishers push JSON-encoded `Event` payloads to per-topic Pub/Sub
topics; subscribers pull messages from per-subscriber subscriptions and
dispatch to async handlers.

Topic + *durable* subscription provisioning is *not* done here — it's
expected to be managed via Terraform / gcloud at deploy time so
subscription configuration (ack deadlines, retry policies, dead-letter
topics) lives with infra. This class assumes those already exist. The
SOLE exception is per-process *broadcast* subscriptions (see
``subscribe(broadcast=True)``): their names embed a per-process id so
Terraform can't pre-provision them, so ``_ensure_broadcast_subscription``
creates one at ``start()`` (with an ``expiration_policy`` backstop) and
deletes it at ``stop()``.

Import is lazy so `common.events` can be imported in OSS standalone
installs that don't have `google-cloud-pubsub` installed.

**Cross-environment isolation.** When two environments (e.g. production
and a sandbox/staging) share one GCP project, they also share the topic
namespace — topic names are not env-scoped. Each env gets its *own*
subscription per topic, so Pub/Sub fans every published message out to
*both* environments' subscribers. The foreign-env subscriber then does
real work (a worker re-runs the embed/enrich provider call on the payload
content) before its tenant-scoped DB write no-ops, wasting spend and
emitting `target row missing` noise. To prevent this, the bus stamps each
message with a `source_env` attribute (see ``SOURCE_ENV_ATTRIBUTE``) and
``_pull_loop`` ack-drops any message whose `source_env` differs from this
process's ``env`` *before* decode/dispatch. The guard is a no-op when
``env`` is unset or the attribute is absent (backward-compatible with
publishers that predate the attribute), so it is safe to roll out in any
order. A follow-up moves the same drop server-side via a subscription
`filter` on the attribute.

        project_id: GCP project that owns the topics/subscriptions.
        subscription_prefix: Applied to the *handler side* when we call
            `subscribe(topic, handler)`. Subscriptions are named
            ``f"{subscription_prefix}--{topic}"`` so a single topic can

    The handler side spawns one async pull task per subscription when
    `start()` is called. Each pull task receives a message, runs the
    handler, and ack/nacks based on the outcome. Pub/Sub handles redelivery
    on nack.

    **At-least-once delivery**: handlers registered against this bus
    *must* be idempotent. Pub/Sub redelivers on ack failure and on
    handler exceptions; a handler that already ran can be invoked again
    for the same event. Use `event.event_id` as a natural dedup key.

        False in three cases:

        1. ``stop()`` is in progress. The ``_stopped`` flag flips True
           at the top of ``stop()`` (before any await point) and resets
           False only at the very end — while True the bus has already
           cancelled its pull tasks and is actively tearing down.
           Checking this first means the graceful-shutdown window
           starts when ``stop()`` is *called*, not when it *completes*.
        2. Handlers were registered via ``subscribe()`` but ``start()``
           was never awaited — the pull loops don't exist, so every
           inbound event is silently dropped. ``_failed_subscriptions``
           is empty in this case (the loops never ran) so we rely on
           ``_started`` to distinguish "deliberately publisher-only"
           (no handlers, healthy) from "forgot to call start()" (has
           handlers but unstarted, unhealthy). This case also carries
           the post-``stop()`` state: once ``_stopped`` resets to
           False, a bus with handlers still reports unhealthy until
           ``start()`` is (re-)called.
