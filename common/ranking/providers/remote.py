"""Remote reranker — HTTP call to a separate ranking service (sidecar).

Mirrors ``OpenAIEmbeddingProvider`` + ``OPENAI_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL``: the model
lives in its own service (a self-hosted TEI reranker, typically GPU bge, or a
hosted Cohere-style ``/rerank``) and core-api sends it the query + candidate
texts over HTTP. This keeps torch out of the core-api image — the deployment
pattern the stack already uses for the TEI *embedder*.

Contract (TEI-native ``/rerank``, the primary target since the infra runs TEI):

    POST {RANK_BASE_URL}/rerank
    { "query": "<query>", "texts": ["<candidate 0>", "<candidate 1>", ...] }
    -> [ {"index": 1, "score": 0.91}, {"index": 0, "score": 0.42}, ... ]

The response is a ranked list of ``{index, score}`` (index = position in the
input ``texts``). We also accept a Cohere-style wrapper
(``{"results": [{"index", "relevance_score"}]}``) so a Cohere-compatible
endpoint drops in without an adapter. Scores are re-projected back to INPUT
order — the caller (RerankResults) owns the sort.

# user's stored memory text. This cap bounds how much of that a rerank
# misconfiguration can write into logs that may ship off-box. Raise it only

        model behind different ``rank_api_key`` credentials — without putting
        any of those values, least of all the credential, into the string. The

        The instance is a proxy for the config, not a permanent name for it:
        ``_remote_ranker_cache`` is LRU-bounded (32), so a process cycling

        scope from the config instead would hold across eviction, but only by
