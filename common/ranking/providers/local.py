"""Local in-process cross-encoder ranker (MiniLM), mirrors ``LocalEmbedding``.

Lazy-loads a sentence-transformers ``CrossEncoder`` under an
``asyncio.Lock`` and scores (query, content) pairs in a thread executor
(``predict`` is sync CPU work). ``sentence-transformers`` is lazy-imported
so it stays an optional dependency — if it is absent the load raises
``PermanentRankError``, so the service layer degrades to first-stage order
immediately (no retry, since the dependency will still be missing) and reports
it once at ERROR rather than per search.

Viable only at small pools: MiniLM-L6 (22M) is ~50-150ms CPU at pool<=20
(A50 latency spike); a large model (bge-base, 278M) is NOT CPU-viable
in-process (1-5s) and belongs behind the ``remote`` provider.
