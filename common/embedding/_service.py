        Passing *bulk_batch_size* marks this as a failed BULK call: it
        advances a second streak that only a bulk success clears, and
        reports it separately.

        That second streak exists because the shared one cannot see a
        bulk-only outage. Every path through this module shares one
        ``_EmbeddingStats`` PER BACKEND, so a service that also serves
        search traffic records a success per query embed, which resets
        ``consecutive_failures`` and holds it under the threshold no
        matter how many bulk calls fail in between. Not hypothetical:
        prod TEI rejected 100% of bulk embeds for 30+ days on a
        batch-size cap and "Embedding service degraded" never fired once,
        because query embeds kept clearing the streak.

        What the bulk report adds over the callers' own per-batch ERROR
        (which already carries the provider's traceback) is the CONSECUTIVE
        count: N failures with no bulk success in between distinguishes
        "systematically broken" from "occasionally flaky", which a stream
        of independent tracebacks cannot. It is not the per-occurrence
        detector — the callers' ERROR is — so WARNING, not ERROR: by
        contract this cascades into the per-item fallback, which usually
        still persists correct embeddings. Degradation, not data loss.

        *bulk_batch_size* is the size the CALLER asked for, which is not
        necessarily the size of any single request — the provider splits
        oversized requests to its own backend's cap. The message says so
        rather than naming a number: this class is provider-agnostic (Fake
        and Local never chunk; the OpenAI provider's cap is 32 self-hosted
        but 2048 hosted), so quoting one constant here would be wrong for
        most backends and would send an operator to re-tune a knob their
        deployment does not use — the same misdirection in the opposite
        direction. The size is still worth reporting: it identifies which
        caller is affected (bulk write at 100 vs re-embed at 50) without
        expanding a traceback.

        Both streaks are per BACKEND — see ``_stats_by_scope``. An earlier
        version of this class was process-wide, which meant one tenant's
        healthy bulk success cleared a different tenant's broken backend:
        the same masking this method exists to fix, one level up.

    Worth naming separately because a 429 is the only evidence any single

    against the degraded-provider streak, and was retried).

    Deliberately NOT a ``TimeoutError`` subclass, unlike its sibling. A

    Raises on any provider-side error. Both bulk callers wrap this in
    ``try: ... except Exception:``, so any exception type is acceptable
    here — what matters is that the failure stats counter increments so
    the registry-level degraded-provider trip-wire fires consistently
    with the single-embed paths (``get_embedding`` /
    ``get_query_embedding``).

    What they do with the exception differs, and it is worth being exact
    because an earlier version of this docstring credited both with a
    per-item retry:

    * ``_reembed_batch_via_provider`` DOES fan the batch out per item,
      through the inline/deferred router — so in deferred mode a rejected
      batch becomes N durable EMBED_REQUESTED messages that drain at
      core-worker's sequential rate. That is the demand smoothing, and it
      is why a 429 here needs no special caller handling.
    * ``create_memories_bulk`` does NOT. Inline it re-raises (504 on a
      timeout); otherwise it logs and leaves ``embedding=NULL`` for the
      backfill sweep to collect. Durable either way, but there is no
      second attempt in this request.

    A failed ``embed_batch`` also advances a bulk-only failure streak that
    single-embed successes cannot reset — see ``record_failure`` for why
    that is needed and for the incident behind it.

    Note this is the SERVICE layer: a request larger than the backend's
    accepted batch is split inside the provider, which is the only layer
    that knows its own cap, so *texts* has no length limit imposed here.

    *budget_s* is the caller's OWN deadline, and passing it is what keeps a
    slow backend attributable. Callers enforce their budgets by cancelling
    us, and a cancellation says only "time ran out" — not which layer ate
    it. Given the budget, this bounds the provider call at
    ``budget_s - EMBEDDING_BUDGET_MARGIN_S`` so the inner cap fires first
    and raises ``TimeoutError`` from HERE, naming the embed as the thing
    that overran. Without it the provider is free to sit for
    ``OPENAI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` (25 s), which already exceeds the 8 s
    ``BULK_STRONG_EMBED_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` outright — that budget could never
    be the one to fire. Same principle the concurrency gate applies; see
    ``EMBEDDING_GATE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``.

    Omitting it keeps the previous behaviour, which is right for callers
    that have no deadline of their own to be under.

    Two error shapes are explicitly accounted for:

    1. ``ValueError`` from ``get_embedding_provider`` — env-var
       misconfiguration (e.g. ``OPENAI_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`` ⊕
       ``SEND_DIMENSIONS`` mismatch). Used to propagate as an unhandled
       exception that bulk callers caught generically but bypassed
       ``_stats.record_failure``, so the trip-wire never fired under
       sustained misconfig. Now records a failure and re-raises. Counted
       as a plain failure, NOT a bulk failure — the batch never ran.
    2. Any provider-side exception from ``embed_batch`` — auth, HTTP
       client errors, provider quota, a batch-size cap. Re-raises as
       before; now also counted as a bulk failure.
