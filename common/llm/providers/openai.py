"""OpenAI-compatible LLM provider — moved from
``core_api.providers.openai_provider`` (CAURA-595).

Wraps the ``openai`` SDK (AsyncOpenAI) to implement the
``LLMProvider`` protocol. Supports OpenAI, Anthropic (via OpenAI-
compatible endpoint), and OpenRouter by varying the ``base_url``
parameter.

The previous ``settings.openai_request_timeout_seconds`` import has
been replaced with a constructor arg defaulting to
``OPENAI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` from ``common.llm.constants`` —
the registry passes the resolved value through. Same decoupling
shape Step B used for ``OpenAIEmbeddingProvider``.

        sample non-deterministically without a seed. Callers that need
        repeatable output across retries (entity extraction, dedup
        disambiguation) should pass a stable seed derived from the

        ``response_schema`` (A5b #3): when provided, switches to

        Pydantic-generated schemas don't always satisfy OpenAI's strict-

        ``"low"`` / ``"medium"`` / ``"high"`` / ``"xhigh"``); an
        unsupported value is a 400 on every call. ``None`` (the default)
        omits the parameter entirely, because non-reasoning models
